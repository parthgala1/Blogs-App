<h2>Overview:</h2><br></br><p> Stock price prediction is a challenging task in financial markets, requiring advanced techniques and models to analyze historical data and forecast future trends. In this project, we employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict stock prices based on historical price data and other relevant features. Our objective was to develop an accurate and reliable model capable of generating meaningful predictions, helping investors and traders make informed decisions in the stock market.</p><br></br><h2>Project Phases:</h2><br></br><h3>1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:</h3><br></br><ol><li>Acquiring Historical Price Data: We obtained historical stock price data for the target stocks from financial data providers or public APIs, ensuring a sufficient amount of data for training and testing.</li><li>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: We cleaned and preprocessed the raw data by handling missing values, scaling the features, and engineering new features such as technical indicators and moving averages.</li><li>Dataset Splitting: We split the preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring that each set contained representative samples from different time periods.</li></ol><br></br><h3>2. Model Development and Training:</h3><br></br><ol><li>Architecture Design: We designed the architecture of the LSTM model, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions.</li><li>Model Training: We trained the LSTM model on the training data using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.</li><li>Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the LSTM model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate, to optimize its performance and generalization ability.</li></ol><br></br><h3>3. Prediction and Evaluation:</h3><br></br><ol><li>Forecasting Future Prices: We used the trained LSTM model to make predictions on the validation and testing data, generating forecasts for future stock prices.</li><li>Evaluation Metrics: We evaluated the performance of the LSTM model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices.</li><li>Visualization: We visualized the predicted and actual stock prices over time, enabling us to analyze the accuracy and reliability of the LSTM model's predictions.</li></ol><br></br><p>By the end of this project, we had developed a sophisticated LSTM model capable of accurately predicting stock prices based on historical data and relevant features. Whether it was forecasting short-term price movements or identifying long-term trends, our LSTM-based prediction model provided valuable insights and decision support for investors and traders navigating the complexities of the stock market.</p>
